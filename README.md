# Virtual Doctor - The Chaotic Evil ConsultantðŸ‘»

## Overview

Welcome to the "Virtual Doctor" project, where the medical advice is as unpredictable as it is unnerving. This project is the brainchild of a team of first-time hackathon participants, united by a love for humor, chaos, and the avant-garde. Leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT API and the cutting-edge Langchain library, we've concocted a devilish doctor, a purveyor of pandemonium, who doles out the most chaotic medical ideas known (and unknown) to mankind.

## Features

- **Chaotic Consultations:** Our Virtual Doctor thrives in the mayhem of medicine, providing advice that's as bizarre as it is bewildering.
- **AI-Driven Diagnoses:** Harnessing the OpenAI API, our doctor conjures up consultations that are anything but conventional.
- **Langchain Integration:** Merging the madness with the method, Langchain adds a layer of "Forward Thinking" to our chaotic concoctions.

## How to Use

1. **Summon the Doctor:** Visit our web portal and dare to ask your medical question.
2. **Brace Yourself:** Prepare for an answer that defies logic, reason, and probably medical science.
3. **Enjoy the Madness:** Remember, it's all in good fun! Our Virtual Doctor's advice is for entertainment purposes only.

## Disclaimer

The Virtual Doctor is a satirical project created for entertainment. The advice provided by our AI doctor is not medical advice and should not be taken seriously. Always consult a real doctor for any health concerns.
